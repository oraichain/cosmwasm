abort = []
# iterator allows us to iterate over all DB items in a given range
# optional as some merkle stores (like tries) don't support this
# given Ethereum 1.0, 2.0, Substrate, and other major projects use Tries
# we keep this optional, to allow possible future integration (or different Cosmos Backends)
iterator = []
# staking exposes bindings to a required staking moudle in the runtime, via new
# CosmosMsg types, and new QueryRequest types. This should only be enabled on contracts
# that require these types, so other contracts can be used on systems with eg. PoA consensus
staking = []
# stargate enables stargate-dependent messages and queries, like raw protobuf messages
# as well as ibc-related functionality
stargate = []
# This feature makes `BankQuery::Supply` available for the contract to call, but requires
# the host blockchain to run CosmWasm `1.1.0` or higher.
cosmwasm_1_1 = []
# This feature makes `GovMsg::VoteWeighted` available for the contract to call, but requires
# the host blockchain to run CosmWasm `1.2.0` or higher.
cosmwasm_1_2 = ["cosmwasm_1_1"]
# This feature makes `BankQuery::DenomMetadata` available for the contract to call, but requires
# the host blockchain to run CosmWasm `1.3.0` or higher.
cosmwasm_1_3 = ["cosmwasm_1_2"]
# Together with the `iterator` feature this enables additional imports for more
# efficient iteration over DB keys or values.
# It also makes `DistributionQuery::{DelegationRewards, DelegationTotalRewards, DelegatorValidators}`
# available for the contract to call.
# It requires the host blockchain to run CosmWasm `1.4.0` or higher.
