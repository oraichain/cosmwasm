[#1929]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1929
[#1954]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1954

### Changed

- cosmwasm-std: Replace `ContractInfoResponse::new` with new (unstable)
  constructor, remove `SubMsgExecutionResponse` (Use `SubMsgResponse` instead)
  and remove `PartialEq<&str> for Addr` (validate the address and use
  `PartialEq<Addr> for Addr` instead). ([#1879])
- cosmwasm-std: `Uint{64,128}::full_mul` now take `Into<Self>` as an argument.
  ([#1874])
- cosmwasm-vm: Make `CacheOptions` non-exhaustive and add a constructor.
  ([#1898])
- cosmwasm-std: `Coin::new` now takes `Into<Uint128>` instead of `u128` as the
  first argument and `DecCoin::new` takes `Into<Decimal256>` instead of
  `Decimal256`. ([#1902])
- cosmwasm-std: Make inner values of `CanonicalAddr` and `Binary` private and
  add constructor for `Binary`. ([#1876])
- cosmwasm-vm: Make inner value of `Size` private and add constructor. ([#1876])
- cosmwasm-vm: Reduce gas values by a factor of 1000. ([#1884])
- cosmwasm-std: Upgrade to `serde-json-wasm` 1.0. This means `u128` and `i128`
  are now serialized as numbers instead of strings. Use `Uint128` and `Int128`
  instead. ([#1939])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `ack` parameter to `IbcReceiveResponse::new` and remove
  `IbcReceiveResponse::set_ack` ([#1940])

  `DelegationRewardsResponse`, `DelegatorReward`, `DelegatorValidatorsResponse`,
  `PortIdResponse`, `ListChannelsResponse`, `ChannelResponse`,
  `BondedDenomResponse`, `AllDelegationsResponse`, `Delegation`,
  `DelegationResponse`, `FullDelegation`, `AllValidatorsResponse`,
  `ValidatorResponse` and `Validator` non-exhaustive. Add `Validator::create`
  and `FullDelegation::create` to allow creating them in a stable way. Use
  `Addr` type for `ContractInfoResponse::{creator, admin}`. ([#1883])
- cosmwasm-std: Change `DistributionQuerier::new` to take `IntoIterator` instead
  of `HashMap`. ([#1941])
- cosmwasm-vm: Make `instantiate` entrypoint optional. ([#1933])

  `AnalysisReport::required_capabilities` a `BTreeSet`. ([#1949])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Checksum` type and change type of
  `CodeInfoResponse::checksum` to that. ([#1944])
- cosmwasm-std: Removed `backtraces` feature, use the `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` env
  variable instead. Error variants that previously only contained a `backtrace`
  field with the feature enabled now always contain it. ([#1967])
- cosmwasm-vm: Removed `backtraces` feature, use the `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` env
  variable instead. All `VmError` variants now have a `backtrace` field.
  ([#1967])
- cosmwasm-std: Replace `MockApi` with bech32 implementation. ([#1914])
- cosmwasm-vm: Replace `MockApi` with bech32 implementation. ([#1914])

## [1.5.0] - 2023-10-31

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Add `addr_make` and `with_prefix` for
  `cosmwasm_std::testing::MockApi` ([#1905]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `abs` and `unsigned_abs` for `Int{64,128,256,512}`
  ([#1854]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `From<Int{64,128,256}>` for `Int512`,
  `TryFrom<Int{128,256,512}>` for `Int64`, `TryFrom<Int{256,512}>` for `Int128`,
  `TryFrom<Int512>` for `Int256` and `Int256::from_i128` for const contexts
  ([#1861]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Int{64,128,256}::{checked_multiply_ratio, full_mul}`
  ([#1866])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `is_negative` for `Int{64,128,256,512}` ([#1867]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `TryFrom<Uint{256,512}> for Uint64` and
  `TryFrom<Uint{A}> for Int{B}` where `A >= B` ([#1870]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `to_json_{vec,binary,string}` and `from_json` and deprecate
  `to_{vec,binary}` in favor of `to_json_{vec,binary}` and `from_{slice,binary}`
  in favor of `from_json`. ([#1886])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `SignedDecimal` and `SignedDecimal256` ([#1807]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Allow float operations with NaN canonicalization ([#1864]).

[#1807]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1807
[#1864]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1864

### Changed

- cosmwasm-vm: Added `.module` extension to file names in the file system cache
  ([#1913]).

[#1913]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1913

## [1.4.1] - 2023-10-09

## Fixed

- cosmwasm-vm: Fix a 1.3.x -> 1.4.0 regression bug leading to a _Wasmer runtime
  error: RuntimeError: out of bounds memory access_ in cases when the Wasm file
  is re-compiled and used right away. ([#1907])

[#1907]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1907

### Changed

- cosmwasm-check: Use "=" for pinning the versions of cosmwasm-vm and
  cosmwasm-std dependencies. This ensures that you can use an older version of
  cosmwasm-check together with the VM of the same version by doing
  `cargo install cosmwasm-check@1.4.1`. A typical use case would be to check a
  contract with CosmWasm 1.4, 1.5 and 2.0. Note that other dependencies are
  still upgraded when using `cargo install` which may lead to API, behavioural
  or compiler incompatibilities. The
  [--locked](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html#dealing-with-the-lockfile)
  feature allows you use the versions locked when the release was created.

## [1.4.0] - 2023-09-04

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Implement `Not` for `Uint{64,128,256}` ([#1799]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add iterators for `Coins` ([#1806]).
- cosmwasm-std: Make `abs_diff` const for `Uint{256,512}` and
  `Int{64,128,256,512}`. It is now const for all integer types.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `TryFrom<Decimal256>` for `Decimal` ([#1832])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `StdAck`. ([#1512])
- cosmwasm-std: Add new imports `db_next_{key, value}` for iterating storage
  keys / values only and make `Storage::{range_keys, range_values}` more
  efficient. This requires the `cosmwasm_1_4` feature to be enabled. ([#1834])
- cosmwasm-std: Add
  `DistributionQuery::{DelegationRewards, DelegationTotalRewards, DelegatorValidators}`.
  This requires the `cosmwasm_1_4` feature to be enabled. ([#1788])
- cosmwasm-std: Export module `cosmwasm_std::storage_keys` with
  `namespace_with_key`, `to_length_prefixed` and `to_length_prefixed_nested` to
  make it easier to use the strandard storage key layout documented in
  [STORAGE_KEYS.md](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/v1.5.0/docs/STORAGE_KEYS.md)
  in other libraries such as cw-storage-plus or indexers. ([#1676])

[#1788]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1788

### Changed

- cosmwasm-vm: Avoid using loupe for getting the `Module` size in the file
  system cache to prepare for the Wasmer 3 upgrade.
- cosmwasm-vm: When enabling `print_debug` the debug logs are now printed to
  STDERR instead of STDOUT by default ([#1667]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Add `Instance::set_debug_handler`/`unset_debug_handler` to allow
  customizing the handling of debug messages emitted by the contract ([#1667]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Upgrade Wasmer to version 4.1. ([#1674], [#1693], [#1701],
  [#1793])
- cosmwasm-check: Update clap dependency to version 4 ([#1677])
- cosmwasm-vm: Use `wasmparser` for initial validation instead of `parity-wasm`
  ([#1786])
- cosmwasm-std: Make constructors `Decimal{,256}::{percent,permille,bps}` const
- cosmwasm-std: Use new `db_next_key` import to make `skip` and `nth`
  implementation of `range` iterators more efficient. This requires the
  `cosmwasm_1_4` feature to be enabled. ([#1838])

## [1.3.3] - 2023-08-22

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Implement `into_empty` for `QuerierWrapper`, `Deps` and
  `DepsMut`.

## [1.3.2] - 2023-08-15

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-std: Export `CoinFromStrError`, `CoinsError` and `DivisionError`

## [1.3.1] - 2023-07-26

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-std: Export `DelegatorWithdrawAddressResponse`,
  `DenomMetadataResponse` and `AllDenomMetadataResponse` which were added in
  `1.3.0` ([#1795]).

[#1795]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1795

### Changed

- cosmwasm-std: Query responses are now exported, even if the corresponding
  cargo feature is not enabled ([#1795]).

## [1.3.0] - 2023-07-17

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-vm: Add missing cache stats increment when calling `pin`.

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Implement `BankQuery::AllDenomMetadata` to allow querying all
  the denom metadata and `BankQuery::DenomMetadata` to query a specific one. In
  order to use this query in a contract, the `cosmwasm_1_3` feature needs to be
  enabled for the `cosmwasm_std` dependency. This makes the contract
  incompatible with chains running anything lower than CosmWasm `1.3.0`.
  ([#1647])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `DistributionQuery::DelegatorWithdrawAddress`. Also needs
  the `cosmwasm_1_3` feature (see above). ([#1593])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `DistributionMsg::FundCommunityPool`. Also needs the
  `cosmwasm_1_3` feature (see above). ([#1747])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `FromStr` impl for `Coin`. ([#1684])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Coins` helper to handle multiple coins. ([#1687])
- cosmwasm-vm: Add `Cache::save_wasm_unchecked` to save Wasm blobs that have
  been checked before. This is useful for state-sync where we know the Wasm code
  was checked when it was first uploaded. ([#1635])
- cosmwasm-vm: Allow sign extension Wasm opcodes in static validation. This
  allows contracts to be compiled with Rust 1.70.0 and above. ([#1727])
- cosmwasm-std: Add trait functions `Storage::range_keys` and
  `Storage::range_values`. The default implementations just use
  `Storage::range`. Later this can be implemented more efficiently. ([#1748])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Int64`, `Int128`, `Int256` and `Int512` signed integer
  types. ([#1718])

### Changed

- cosmwasm-vm: Add checks for table section of Wasm blob ([#1631]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Limit number of imports during static validation ([#1629]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Add target (triple + CPU features) into the module cache
  directory to avoid using modules compiled for a different system. Bump
  `MODULE_SERIALIZATION_VERSION` to "v6". ([#1664])
- cosmwasm-vm: Add `.wasm` extension to stored wasm files ([#1686]).

[#1664]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1664
[#1686]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1686

### Deprecated

- cosmwasm-storage: All exports are deprecated because this crate will be
  removed with CosmWasm 2.0 ([#1596]).

[#1596]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1596

## [1.2.7] - 2023-06-19

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Add `<<` and `<<=` implementation for `Uint{64,128,256,512}`
  types. ([#1723])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Timestamp::{plus,minus}_{minutes, hours, days}`. ([#1729])
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Decimal::bps` and `Decimal256::bps` to create a decimal
  from a basis point value ([#1715]).

[#1723]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1723
[#1729]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1729
[#1715]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1715

### Changed

- cosmwasm-std: Coin uses shorter `Coin { 123 "ucosm" }` format for Debug
  ([#1704])

[#1704]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1704

## [1.2.6] - 2023-06-05

### Changed

- cosmwasm-vm: Bumped module serialization version from v4 to v5 to invalidate
  potentially corrupted caches caused by Rust update. See
  https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/issues/426 for more information. ([#1708])

[#1708]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1708

## [1.2.5] - 2023-05-02

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Implement `PartialEq` for `Addr == &Addr` and `&Addr == Addr` as
  well as `Event == &Event` and `&Event == Event` ([#1672]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `#[must_use]` annotations to `Uint64`, `Uint128`, `Uint256`,
  `Uint512`, `Decimal` and `Decimal256` math operations ([#1678])

[#1672]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1672
[#1678]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1678

### Deprecated

- cosmwasm-std: The PartialEq implementations between `Addr` and `&str`/`String`
  are deprecated because they are not considered to be safe. In almost all cases
  you want to convert both sides of the equation to `Addr` first. If you really
  want to do a string comparison, use `Addr::as_str()` explicitly. ([#1671])

[#1671]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1671

## [1.2.4] - 2023-04-17

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-vm: Add call depths limit

## [1.2.3] - 2023-03-22

- cosmwasm-vm: Use saturating increments for `Stats` fields to ensure we don't
  run into overflow issues.

## [1.2.2] - 2023-03-08

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Add an IBC querier implementation to `testing::MockQuerier`
  ([#1620], [#1624]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `#[must_use]` annotations to `Timestamp` math functions.

[#1620]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1620
[#1624]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1624

### Fixed

- all: Fix `backtraces` feature for newer versions of Rust. This still requires
  Rust nightly ([#1613]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add missing export `CheckedMultiplyFractionError` ([#1608]).

[#1608]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1608
[#1613]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1613

## [1.2.1] - 2023-01-30

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Add `Decimal{,256}::to_uint_floor` and `::to_uint_ceil` for
  efficient and explicit decimal to uint conversion ([#1603]).

[#1603]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1603

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-std: Make fields of `WeightedVoteOption` public to allow constructing
  it ([#1597]).

[#1597]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1597

### Changed

- cosmwasm-std: Improve readability of `Debug` output for `Decimal` and
  `Decimal256` ([#1600]).

[#1600]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1600

## [1.2.0] - 2023-01-24

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Add `GovMsg::VoteWeighted`. In order to use this in a contract,
  the `cosmwasm_1_2` feature needs to be enabled for the `cosmwasm_std`
  dependency. This makes the contract incompatible with chains running versions
  of CosmWasm earlier than 1.2.0 ([#1481]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `instantiate2_address` which allows calculating the
  predictable addresses for `MsgInstantiateContract2` ([#1437], [#1554]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `WasmMsg::Instantiate2` (requires `cosmwasm_1_2`, see
  `GovMsg::VoteWeighted` above) to instantiate contracts at a predictable
  address ([#1436], [#1554])).
- cosmwasm-schema: In contracts, `cosmwasm schema` will now output a separate
  JSON Schema file for each entrypoint in the `raw` subdirectory ([#1478],
  [#1533]).
- cosmwasm-std: Upgrade `serde-json-wasm` dependency to 0.5.0 which adds map
  support to `to_vec`/`to_binary` and friends.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `AsRef<[u8]>` for `Binary` and `HexBinary` ([#1550]).
- cosmwasm-std: Allow constructing `SupplyResponse` via a `Default`
  implementation ([#1552], [#1560]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Never` type which cannot be instantiated. This can be used
  as the error type for `ibc_packet_receive` or `ibc_packet_ack` to gain
  confidence that the implementations never errors and the transaction does not
  get reverted. ([#1513])
- cosmwasm-std: Add new `WasmQuery::CodeInfo` to get the checksum of a code ID
  ([#1561]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Add `Cache::remove_wasm` to remove obsolete Wasm blobs and their
  compiled modules.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement fraction multiplication and division. Assists with
  Uint & Decimal arithmetic and exposes methods for flooring/ceiling result
  ([#1485], [#1566]).

[#1566]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1566

### Changed

- cosmwasm-vm: Avoid exposing OS specific file system errors in order to test
  cosmwasm-vm on Windows. This gives us confidence for integrating cosmwasm-vm
  in a libwasmvm build on Windows. This change is likely to be consensus
  breaking as error messages change. ([#1406])
- cosmwasm-vm: Use `Display` representation for embedding Wasmer
  `InstantiationError`s ([#1508]).

[#1406]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1406
[#1508]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1508

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-schema: Nested QueryMsg with generics is now supported by the
  QueryResponses macro ([#1516]).
- cosmwasm-schema: A nested QueryMsg no longer causes runtime errors if it
  contains doc comments.
- cosmwasm-std/cosmwasm-vm: Increase length limit for address conversion in
  `MockApi` to support addresses longer than 54 bytes ([#1529]).

[#1516]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1516
[#1529]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1529

## [1.1.9] - 2022-12-06

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-schema: Fix type fully qualified path to symbol `QueryResponses` in
  macro `cosmwasm_schema::generate_api!` ([#1527]).

[#1527]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1527

## [1.1.8] - 2022-11-22

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-schema: Fix type params on `QueryMsg` causing a compiler error when
  used with the `QueryResponses` derive macro.

## [1.1.6] - 2022-11-16

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Add `From` implementations to convert between
  `CanonicalAddr`/`Binary` as well as `CanonicalAddr`/`HexBinary` ([#1463]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `From` implementations to convert `u8` arrays to
  `CanonicalAddr` ([#1463]).
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `PartialEq` between `CanonicalAddr` and
  `HexBinary`/`Binary` ([#1463]).

[#1463]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1463

### Changed

- all: Bump a few dependency versions to make the codebase compile with
  `-Zminimal-versions` ([#1465]).
- cosmwasm-profiler: Package was removed 🪦. It served its job showing us that
  we cannot properly measure different runtimes for differet Wasm opcodes.
- cosmwasm-schema: schema generation is now locked to produce strictly
  `draft-07` schemas
- cosmwasm-schema: `QueryResponses` derive now sets the `JsonSchema` trait bound
  on the generated `impl` block. This allows the contract dev to not add a
  `JsonSchema` trait bound on the type itself.

[#1465]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1465

## [1.1.5] - 2022-10-17

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Add `wrapping_add`, `wrapping_sub`, `wrapping_mul` and
  `wrapping_pow` to `Uint256`/`Uint512`.
- cosmwasm-schema: Better error messaging when attempting to compile schema
  generator for `wasm32`
- cosmwasm-vm: In the `secp256k1_verify`, `secp256k1_recover_pubkey`,
  `ed25519_verify` and `ed25519_batch_verify` import implementations we now exit
  early if the gas left is not sufficient to perform the operation.

### Changed

- cosmwasm-std: Remove `non_exhaustive` from IBC types `IbcChannelOpenMsg`,
  `IbcChannelConnectMsg` and `IbcChannelCloseMsg` in order to allow exhaustive
  matching over the possible scenarios without an unused fallback case
  ([#1449]).

[#1449]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1449

## [1.1.4] - 2022-10-03

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-schema: Properly analyze schemas generated for `untagged` enums

## [1.1.3] - 2022-09-29

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-schema: `IntegrityError` is now public

## [1.1.2] - 2022-09-19

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Add testing macro `assert_approx_eq!` for comparing two integers
  to be relatively close to each other ([#1417]).
- cosmwasm-std: Add `HexBinary` which is like `Binary` but encodes to hex
  strings in JSON. Add `StdError::InvalidHex` error case. ([#1425])

[#1417]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1417
[#1425]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1425

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-vm: Bump `MODULE_SERIALIZATION_VERSION` to "v4" because the module
  serialization format changed between Wasmer 2.2 and 2.3 ([#1426]).
- cosmwasm-schema: The `QueryResponses` derive macro now supports `QueryMsg`s
  with generics. ([#1429])

[#1426]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1426
[#1429]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1429

## [1.1.1] - 2022-09-15

### Fixed

- cosmwasm-schema: Using `QueryResponses` with a `QueryMsg` containing a
  unit-like variant will no longer crash. The different variant types in Rust
  are:
  ```rust
  enum QueryMsg {
      UnitLike,
      Tuple(),
      Struct {},
  }
  ```
  It's still recommended to only use struct variants, even if there are no
  fields.

### Changed

- cosmwasm-schema: It is no longer necessary to specify `serde` or `schemars` as
  a dependency in order to make `cosmwasm-schema` macros work.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-09-05

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Implement PartialEq for `Binary` and `u8` arrays.
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Uint{64,128,256,512}::one`.
- cosmwasm-std: Add `Uint{64,128,256,512}::abs_diff` and
  `Decimal{,256}::abs_diff` ([#1334]).
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `From<Decimal> for Decimal256`.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `Rem`/`RemAssign` for `Decimal`/`Decimal256`.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `checked_add`/`_sub`/`_div`/`_rem` for
  `Decimal`/`Decimal256`.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `pow`/`saturating_pow` for `Decimal`/`Decimal256`.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `ceil`/`floor` for `Decimal`/`Decimal256`.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `PartialEq` for reference on one side and owned value
  on the other for all `Uint` and `Decimal` types
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `saturating_add`/`sub`/`mul` for
  `Decimal`/`Decimal256`.
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `BankQuery::Supply` to allow querying the total supply
  of a native token. In order to use this query in a contract, the
  `cosmwasm_1_1` feature needs to be enabled for the `cosmwasm_std` dependency.
  This makes the contract incompatible with chains running CosmWasm `1.0`.
  ([#1356])
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `MIN` const value for all `Uint` and `Decimal` types
- cosmwasm-std: Implement `checked_div_euclid` for `Uint256`/`Uint512`
- cosmwasm-std: Add `QuerierWrapper::query_wasm_contract_info` - this is just a
  convenience helper for querying `WasmQuery::ContractInfo`.
- cosmwasm-check: This is a new binary package that allows running various
  CosmWasm compatibility checks on compiled .wasm files. See
  https://crates.io/crates/cosmwasm-check for usage info.

[#1334]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1334
[#1356]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1356

### Changed

- cosmwasm-vm/cosmwasm-profiler: Upgrade Wasmer to 2.3.0.
- cosmwasm-std: Enable the `abort` feature by default. This provides more
  helpful panic messages via a custom panic handler.
- cosmwasm-std: Make `Decimal{,256}::DECIMAL_PLACES` a public `u32` value.
- cosmwasm-crypto: Bumped `k256` `0.10.4 -> 0.11` and `digest` `0.9 -> 0.10`
  ([#1374]).
- cosmwasm-vm: Rename features to capabilities, including
  1. `features_from_csv` to `capabilities_from_csv`;
  2. `CacheOptions::supported_features` to
     `CacheOptions::available_capabilities`;
  3. `MockInstanceOptions::supported_features` to
     `MockInstanceOptions::available_capabilities`
  4. `Instance::required_features` to `Instance::required_capabilities`
  5. `AnalysisReport::required_features` to
     `AnalysisReport::required_capabilities`.

[#1374]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/pull/1374

### Deprecated

- cosmwasm-vm: The `check_contract` example was deprecated. Please use the new
  crate [cosmwasm-check](https://crates.io/crates/cosmwasm-check) instead
  ([#1371]).

[#1371]: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/1371

## [1.0.0] - 2022-05-14

### Added

- cosmwasm-std: Export `DelegationResponse` ([#1301]).
- cosmwasm-std: When the new `abort` feature is enabled, cosmwasm-std installs a
  panic handler that aborts the contract and passes the panic message to the
  host. The `abort` feature can only be used when deploying to chains that
  implement the import. For this reason, it's not yet enabled by default.
  ([#1299])
- cosmwasm-vm: A new import `abort` is created to abort contract execution when
  requested by the contract. ([#1299])
- cosmwasm-std: Add new `ibc3` feature that allows to use IBC-Go V3 features,
  like version negotiation and exposing relayer address to the contract.
  Requires a compatible wasmd runtime (v0.27.0+) ([#1302])
